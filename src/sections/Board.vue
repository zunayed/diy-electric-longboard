        There are thousands of board you can choose from. You'll notice a lot of people on DIY builds tend to go with stiffer boards. That's because they don't want all the components like batteries to flex while riding. Space under your board is a precious resource and with large batteries, motors and controllers you'll find you're going to run out of space fast. You can try to separate out your battery and controllers to each of the board ends but you now can't use the middle of the board. For this build I chose to go with a stiff 44" longboard. Other things to consider is clearance!

        You need to make sure you have enough clearance to mount your motor and mount. I went with the Caliber II trucks. It seems to be a popular choice among builds and from a trusted brand.

        Larger wheels give you more stability and comfort and helps in cities where the governments waste your tax dollars and don't fix shitty roads. The the larger the wheel the more top speed you can reach but at the expense of torque. 83mm seems to be a common size to use but I opted for 90mm to handle NYC.
