      These parts make up the drive train of an electric skateboard. They help transfer power from the motor to the wheels. There are some formulas and calculations you can do to help figure the configuration that is right for you.

      The mount is simply a way to attach the motor to the truck. There are two pully teeth, one for the motor and one for the wheel. the motor teeth divided by the motor wheel gets you the gear ratio. This ratio in combination with wheel size, battery voltage and motor KV rating will help you calculate top speed. Jump to the motor and battery and motor section to understand how battery voltage and motor KV work.
