      The most popular motor types you will see are belt drive single/dual motor and hub motor.
      For this build I'll be using a single belt drive motor. Hub motors are built into the wheel and will be more efficient as there will be less drag. They tend to be smoother delivering acceleration as well.

      With motors you will see a kV rating, which is how many rotations per minute (RPM) the motor will attempt to spin per volt applied. We'll be using this number to help calculate range and top speed
